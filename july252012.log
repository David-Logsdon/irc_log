Jul 24 01:04:17 <DavidLL>	AnthonyUdacity, Will You be loggint this channel? I am but need a backup (No UPS) plan
Jul 24 01:04:56 <DavidLL>	logging lol
Jul 24 01:05:01 <AnthonyUdacity>	I had not planned on it
Jul 24 01:05:06 <AnthonyUdacity>	Probably a good idea.
Jul 24 01:05:20 <DavidLL>	I think zeffii will help
Jul 24 01:05:33 <AnthonyUdacity>	But you all will be more active than I will most likely have time.
Jul 24 01:05:46 <DavidLL>	True
Jul 24 01:07:03 <AnthonyUdacity>	Again, I'm glad you started the initiative.
Jul 24 01:07:34 <AnthonyUdacity>	I'd really like to see how students participate in these large-scale collaboration projects.
Jul 24 01:07:53 <DavidLL>	Me too but I am ready to get started I never like to drag my feet
Jul 24 01:08:23 <AnthonyUdacity>	What's stopping you?
Jul 24 01:09:12 <DavidLL>	We need agreement on some details. I have some code waiting for the group to meld
Jul 24 01:10:19 <AnthonyUdacity>	I'm sure it will come together just fine. What details? Can I help?
Jul 24 01:12:10 <DavidLL>	Yes You have the ability to rmail all who have expressed intrest in the project.
Jul 24 01:12:22 <DavidLL>	But that is too pushy
Jul 24 01:12:39 <DavidLL>	email not rmail
Jul 24 01:13:28 <AnthonyUdacity>	I wouldn't recommend waiting. I'd recommend getting to work if that's what you want to do. Everyone's schedule is different. It's hard to coordinate these types of things over the internet.
Jul 24 01:14:38 <AnthonyUdacity>	With coordination coming from you, mark_up, myself, etc. I'm sure things will go smoothly
Jul 24 01:14:50 <AnthonyUdacity>	Though, slowly as well.
Jul 24 01:14:53 <DavidLL>	True I could add some code to a repo and add a link to the repo to help motivate them
Jul 24 01:16:33 <AnthonyUdacity>	Sounds like a good first step. Love the motivation! The Contest of Contests just recently "ended in CS253 and I hope we can get students such as yourself to initiate the project.
Jul 24 01:17:21 <DavidLL>	What idea won?
Jul 24 01:18:17 <AnthonyUdacity>	I have yet to mark it as the Answer. Waiting on a few details to get wrapped up. But the idea that *will* win:
Jul 24 01:18:20 <AnthonyUdacity>	"Make a Udacity social network , where Udacians can connect with fellow Udacians, to present Udacity as a virtal university and social network as a Udacity Community."
Jul 24 01:18:25 <DavidLL>	There were many great idea's I voted for 4
Jul 24 01:18:34 <AnthonyUdacity>	I loved all of the ideas!

Jul 24 01:25:56 <AnthonyUdacity>	Sorry about that. What'd I miss?
Jul 24 01:26:20 <DavidLL>	Just me.
Jul 24 01:27:08 <DavidLL>	I was re-reading the contest of contests post again
Jul 24 01:29:35 <AnthonyUdacity>	I definitely have some big plans for the content that the student have posted
Jul 24 01:29:52 <DavidLL>	Could You set the topic to Welcome this channel is being logged if You get no replies all remarks will be added to a file location to be determined?
Jul 24 01:29:59 <AnthonyUdacity>	And I appreciate all of the work that active members such as yourself have put into the forum. I hope to see that continue.
Jul 24 01:30:51 <DavidLL>	I enjoyed the classes I have taken so much it's the least I can do.
Jul 24 01:32:12 <DavidLL>	Thed most I could do is donate 5 buck's.
Jul 24 01:32:34 <AnthonyUdacity>	Haha. That won't be necessary. We value your participation and contributions more than your money.
Jul 24 01:32:42 <DavidLL>	annother typo
Jul 24 01:33:02 <DavidLL>	It was a joke
Jul 24 01:34:03 <DavidLL>	Where are You? I mean You are still up.
Jul 24 01:34:36 <AnthonyUdacity>	Yes.
Jul 24 01:35:10 <DavidLL>	I  should be at work but the materials did not show up.
Jul 24 01:36:46 <AnthonyUdacity>	Having trouble regain op status. I'll be right back.

Jul 24 01:43:29 <DavidLL>	Hi jin
Jul 24 01:44:43 <DavidLL>	Have You visited the google doc page?
Jul 24 01:45:47 <DarkSentinel>	yes
Jul 24 01:45:55 <DavidLL>	I like the handel by the way.
Jul 24 01:46:20 <DavidLL>	And what are you willing to help with?
Jul 24 01:46:32 <DavidLL>	handle lol
Jul 24 01:46:39 -->	AnthonyUdacity (~chatzilla@23-24-209-142-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) has joined ##udacitymagazine
Jul 24 01:46:43 <DarkSentinel>	I'm trying to find out what direction the project goes before offering help
Jul 24 01:46:55 *	DarkSentinel is now known as JinKoo

Jul 24 01:47:50 -->	jinkoo (~jinkoo@121.98.213.113) has joined ##udacitymagazine
Jul 24 01:48:00 <DavidLL>	Still no op status
Jul 24 01:48:02 <jinkoo>	ok that's a bug I need to fix
Jul 24 01:48:10 <jinkoo>	(crashing when changing nick)
Jul 24 01:48:18 <DavidLL>	lol
Jul 24 01:48:19 <AnthonyUdacity>	Not sure what I'm doing wrong.
Jul 24 01:48:51 <jinkoo>	but the code is old and stale so I don't want to dive into it
Jul 24 01:49:23 <--	AnthonyUdacity (~chatzilla@23-24-209-142-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net) has left ##udacitymagazine
Jul 24 01:49:25 <DavidLL>	can You say spagettii code
Jul 24 01:49:49 <jinkoo>	it's on GitHub, you can judge for yourself if you like :p
Jul 24 01:51:06 <DavidLL>	we are trying to get anthony back to op status with no luck
Jul 24 01:51:58 <jinkoo>	the mighty power of the op
Jul 24 01:52:21 <DavidLL>	he needs it to set the topic
Jul 24 01:53:53 <DavidLL>	What is it you want to see before joining the project? what can I do to make it a better fit for You?
Jul 24 01:55:24 <jinkoo>	I want to see how it progresses and what my own stuff does.
Jul 24 01:55:51 <jinkoo>	In particular I want to see it get off the ground :) too many projects fizzle out at the planning phase
Jul 24 01:58:01 <DavidLL>	I understand I am also worried about some of the other team members resolve, but I will press on and make it happen.
Jul 24 01:59:53 <DavidLL>	let's see frazzle fizzle play on words cool
Jul 24 02:01:14 <jinkoo>	need to decide on a hosting solution
Jul 24 02:01:45 <jinkoo>	and as mark_up says, decisions by committee tend to not happen
Jul 24 02:03:33 <DavidLL>	By the way if anthony ever gets op status restored I intend to log this channel
Jul 24 02:04:54 <DavidLL>	It is hard to push when its for free but gentle nudge here and there can't hurt
Jul 24 02:07:06 <DavidLL>	I think there needs to be a leader in every group I can't speak for anyone else.
Jul 24 02:07:40 <jinkoo>	yeah
Jul 24 02:07:55 <jinkoo>	leader/coleader can work
Jul 24 02:08:03 <jinkoo>	more than 3 and it's no good
Jul 24 02:08:45 <DavidLL>	As long as there is someone doing the pushing to move the project along.
Jul 24 02:09:09 <jinkoo>	don't even need to push, sometimes someone just needs to make a decision so project can move on
Jul 24 02:10:02 <DavidLL>	Your decision is a push to this hillbilly

Jul 24 02:18:46 <DavidLL>	AnthonyUdacity,  there is a freenode help channel
Jul 24 02:20:19 <DavidLL>	I belive it is #freenode
Jul 24 02:27:34 <DavidLL>	I asked and they said : /msg chanserv op #channel
Jul 24 02:27:59 <jinkoo>	I assume Anthony registered the channel?
Jul 24 02:28:19 <DavidLL>	Yes
Jul 24 02:28:23 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to AnthonyUdacity
Jul 24 02:28:48 <jinkoo>	oh, I could have told you that, lol.
Jul 24 02:29:10 <jinkoo>	I'm used to an irc channel where chanserv and nickserv are almost always broken

Jul 24 02:32:17 *	AnthonyUdacity has changed the topic to: Tomorrow's illustrious Udacity Magazine
Jul 24 02:32:47 <jinkoo>	i'm hopeful at some point the project will lose the magazine title ^_^
Jul 24 02:33:14 <AnthonyUdacity>	Could definitely use a better name
Jul 24 02:33:24 <DavidLL>	Good can you now add the logging statment
Jul 24 02:34:15 <DavidLL>	jinkoo,  do You have any good ideas for a name?
Jul 24 02:35:33 <DavidLL>	I'm all ears(if you could only see my big ears lol)
Jul 24 02:36:49 <jinkoo>	wait to see what it turns into, first
Jul 24 02:37:30 <DavidLL>	Ok then it's still a magazine :P
Jul 24 02:38:31 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to AnthonyUdacity
Jul 24 02:39:22 *	ChanServ removes channel operator status from AnthonyUdacity
Jul 24 02:39:54 <DavidLL>	AnthonyUdacity,  for the full list of commands : /msg chanserv help
Jul 24 02:43:39 <AnthonyUdacity>	Much obliged. Google is pretty useful as well :)
Jul 24 02:43:54 <DavidLL>	My pleasure
Jul 24 02:44:35 <DavidLL>	Google is My friend too
Jul 24 02:46:15 <AnthonyUdacity>	Since I have you two here. Keep in mind that as this project develops not to let it stray too far from the initial idea.
Jul 24 02:47:05 <jinkoo>	I still don't know what the project is trying to do.
Jul 24 02:48:06 <AnthonyUdacity>	I am personally working on an platform that I may be able to integrate seamlessly with this project in the future as long as the project is focused.
Jul 24 02:48:22 <jinkoo>	what _is_ the project?
Jul 24 02:48:36 <AnthonyUdacity>	I'm probably not the right person to ask.
Jul 24 02:48:56 <AnthonyUdacity>	I mentioned to David that the end product seems very similar to the Wiki that already exists.
Jul 24 02:49:07 <jinkoo>	It's Frazzle's initiative.
Jul 24 02:49:17 <AnthonyUdacity>	But I think you all should run with it regardless.
Jul 24 02:49:57 <jinkoo>	I think it needs to integrate with the forums. Some kind of 'sticky' mode that flags the article or comment as particularly knowledge-worthy.
Jul 24 02:50:50 <jinkoo>	the current forum's StackExchange model doesn't work 100% as a forum. And it doesn't work like StackOverflow (which is amazing) because the community and intent is different.
Jul 24 02:51:24 <DavidLL>	It's a platform to showcase the students mastery of the subject they are writing about. There is no better way to know if You have mastered the subject than to try to teach it to others
Jul 24 02:51:29 <jinkoo>	it seems to be a combination of 80% StackOverflow, 10% Reddit and the rest a mixture of facebook and bbs
Jul 24 02:52:00 <jinkoo>	sure, imo that's more the purpose than "what does it look like"?
Jul 24 02:53:10 <jinkoo>	that could be everything from Udacity0.5 with Steve Student instead of Steve Huffman, to an extra part of a forum somewhere dedicated tutorials, to people just editing the existing course wiki.
Jul 24 02:54:29 <jinkoo>	Also, we should try to integrate with friendacity, that project is really sweet.
Jul 24 02:54:56 <DavidLL>	THis is not about Udacity it's about the students
Jul 24 02:55:02 <AnthonyUdacity>	I'd hold off on that thought :)
Jul 24 02:56:02 <AnthonyUdacity>	@DavidLL Exactly!
Jul 24 02:57:19 <DavidLL>	friendacity I know nothing of what is it?
Jul 24 02:57:37 <DavidLL>	it is
Jul 24 02:57:41 <DavidLL>	lol
Jul 24 02:58:19 <jinkoo>	I don't know much about it, someone linked it somewhere. It has a polished look but is still lacking lots of features.
Jul 24 02:58:42 <AnthonyUdacity>	A fair attempt at a social network for Udacity students.
Jul 24 02:59:32 <DavidLL>	I never even saw a link in the forums
Jul 24 02:59:43 <jinkoo>	http://friendacity.appspot.com
Jul 24 03:00:35 <DavidLL>	I may check it out later.
Jul 24 03:03:01 <DavidLL>	I have to get to work on some code. Type at You later.
Jul 24 03:03:36 *	You are now known as DavidLL_Away

Jul 24 13:39:52 <DavidLL>	I am logging the channel and will upload it somewhere when we get more input
Jul 24 13:40:31 <zeffii>	oh cool! might be an idea to state that in the topic 'channel gets logged'
Jul 24 13:40:50 <zeffii>	' don't say anything you wouldn't say to your mom'
Jul 24 13:40:58 <DavidLL>	only anthony can he is op
Jul 24 13:41:13 <DavidLL>	lol
Jul 24 13:41:27 <zeffii>	are you logging with time too?
Jul 24 13:41:33 <DavidLL>	yes
Jul 24 13:41:36 <zeffii>	we can build up a nice timeline :)
Jul 24 13:42:06 <zeffii>	would be a neat dataviz challenge if this gets more trackton
Jul 24 13:42:26 <DavidLL>	I figure we will never get all of us together at the same time
Jul 24 13:43:05 <zeffii>	i'm not a fan of G+
Jul 24 13:43:27 <DavidLL>	me either but I have used it before

Jul 24 13:52:08 <DavidLL>	hillbilly edu
Jul 24 13:52:56 <zeffii>	imagine being able to label articles with several topics tags
Jul 24 13:53:28 <zeffii>	some articles might have a master category, other might not
Jul 24 13:54:19 <zeffii>	then when people go searching, they could tick the topics, and the search would filter the remaining articles
Jul 24 13:55:01 <DavidLL>	yes I think a tag cloud would be good
Jul 24 13:56:20 <DavidLL>	I fixed the file
Jul 24 13:56:40 <zeffii>	c# is pretty cool
Jul 24 13:57:06 <DavidLL>	visual studio saves a ton of time
Jul 24 13:58:26 <zeffii>	ack, i have to go be social :/
Jul 24 13:58:28 <DavidLL>	Do you have any ideas on design
Jul 24 13:58:50 <zeffii>	code stash looks ok, quite minimal

Jul 24 18:51:16 <Frazzle>	howdy
Jul 24 18:51:34 <Frazzle>	yes I am logging
Jul 24 18:51:45 <markup>	oh ok
Jul 24 18:52:28 <markup>	Have there been any discussions here since the channel was created?
Jul 24 18:52:33 <Frazzle>	I will setup a repo for the log
Jul 24 18:52:52 <Frazzle>	not much but some
Jul 24 18:53:14 <markup>	ok
Jul 24 18:53:57 <Frazzle>	file_logger is me also

Jul 24 18:56:41 <Frazzle>	Anthony was here last night and jinkoo 
Jul 24 18:57:01 <Frazzle>	zeffii a little while ago
Jul 24 19:06:08 <markup>	ok
Jul 24 19:06:22 <markup>	It looks like the preferred framework is webapp2
Jul 24 19:12:40 <Frazzle>	yes but I wanted to learn something new
Jul 24 19:12:58 <markup>	Me too.
Jul 24 19:13:44 <markup>	Takes the fun out of it for me.
Jul 24 19:14:20 <Frazzle>	webapp2 without datastore?
Jul 24 19:15:46 <markup>	Nah, I'd prefer if it were hosted on GAE. Makes everything much easier from an administrative standpoint.
Jul 24 19:16:14 <Frazzle>	sql on gae
Jul 24 19:16:37 <markup>	I din't know that was an option.
Jul 24 19:16:47 <markup>	didn't
Jul 24 19:17:08 <Frazzle>	I think it has to be served elsewhere I will look now
Jul 24 19:17:15 <markup>	isn't that in early beta?
Jul 24 19:17:24 <markup>	https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/
Jul 24 19:20:33 <markup>	Hmm, think I'd prefer to stick with the datastore.
Jul 24 19:20:48 <markup>	Are you any good with javascript?
Jul 24 19:21:12 <Frazzle>	Yes I was hopful for using something new
Jul 24 19:21:36 <Frazzle>	Not yet. but I will learn
Jul 24 19:22:39 <markup>	Hi Anthony

Jul 24 19:23:02 <AnthonyUdacity>	Everyone
Jul 24 19:23:06 <AnthonyUdacity>	How's everything going?
Jul 24 19:23:11 <Frazzle>	howdy
Jul 24 19:24:12 <Frazzle>	Good we were discussing using gae with sql but we don't think so
Jul 24 19:24:42 <markup>	@Anthony we will need a github repo. Would you like to host it in an official udacity account, or will you set one up for it, or should one of us do so?
Jul 24 19:25:48 <AnthonyUdacity>	Not sure if you all aware of the github repo that the students are using in the CS101 game contest. Or would you all like me to set up a new one?
Jul 24 19:26:30 <Frazzle>	Is that the same one with the command line tool?
Jul 24 19:26:30 <markup>	A link, please.
Jul 24 19:27:04 <AnthonyUdacity>	https://github.com/udacians/udacity
Jul 24 19:27:30 <AnthonyUdacity>	This was set up by Gundega for the CS101 contest.
Jul 24 19:28:48 <markup>	Best to have it in its own repo, so the issue-tracking, etc doesn't get all muddled up.
Jul 24 19:28:54 <markup>	https://github.com/udacians/magazine  ?
Jul 24 19:29:01 <Frazzle>	Does Gundega rule with her iron fists?
Jul 24 19:30:12 <Frazzle>	I wish I used a different word on that thread
Jul 24 19:30:52 <markup>	?
Jul 24 19:31:55 <Frazzle>	magazine idk maybe something else still a struggle to think up a good name
Jul 24 19:32:21 <markup>	:D
Jul 24 19:32:36 <markup>	https://github.com/udacians/cms
Jul 24 19:33:19 <Frazzle>	That is not bad for the repo but not for a site.
Jul 24 19:33:27 <markup>	We're building a cms… we can come up with a name for the site when it's launched
Jul 24 19:34:47 <Frazzle>	I think deploy often is a good way to not get bogged down
Jul 24 19:38:13 <Frazzle>	I must get ready for work, Type at you later.
Jul 24 19:38:38 *	You are now known as Un_Frazzle
Jul 24 19:43:11 <AnthonyUdacity>	Sorry. What'd I miss?
Jul 24 19:44:12 <markup>	We were just discussing how much of a jerk you were for leaving without saying goodbye. #truestory
Jul 24 19:44:28 <markup>	:P
Jul 24 19:45:19 <AnthonyUdacity>	Haha. Understandable.
Jul 24 19:45:49 <AnthonyUdacity>	Accidentally closed the window.
Jul 24 19:46:26 <markup>	Can you get us a new repo for the website?
Jul 24 19:47:12 <AnthonyUdacity>	No favor of using the Udacity repo?
Jul 24 19:52:33 <AnthonyUdacity>	cms is the name?
Jul 24 19:55:15 <markup>	No. It's not good practice to have completely different projects in the same repo. Will make issue-tracking, merging, etc difficult.
Jul 24 19:55:58 <markup>	Nah, just call it magazine I reckon.
Jul 24 19:58:12 <AnthonyUdacity>	agreed. on both points.
Jul 24 20:00:16 <AnthonyUdacity>	What is your username?
Jul 24 20:00:31 <AnthonyUdacity>	or email for github?
Jul 24 20:02:43 <markup>	mine is mark-up
Jul 24 20:03:53 <AnthonyUdacity>	I'd like to add you as a collaborator if that's alright with you
Jul 24 20:04:40 <markup>	Great :)
Jul 24 20:06:17 <AnthonyUdacity>	https://github.com/udacians/magazine
Jul 24 20:16:28 <AnthonyUdacity>	I'll have to talk to you all later. Lots of work to do.Keep me posted!
Jul 24 20:41:25 <markup>	You around, Un_Frazzle?
Jul 24 23:59:52 <markup>	I created the wiki page here: http://www.udacity.com/wiki/magazine
