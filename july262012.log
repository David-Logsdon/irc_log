Jul 25 07:26:54 *	You are now known as Frazzle
Jul 25 12:29:57 <zeffii>	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5IPlMe83yI   web2py: ideas we stole and ideas we had
Jul 25 12:30:13 <zeffii>	this will act as a dumping ground too for links that relate to what we will be doing :)
Jul 25 12:30:49 <zeffii>	we can sync up the logs regularly for multiple backups
Jul 25 12:50:50 <AnthonyUdacity>	Hey everyone
Jul 25 13:05:25 <Frazzle>	howdy
Jul 25 13:30:37 <zeffii>	ola!
Jul 25 13:46:30 <Frazzle>	AnthonyUdacity, are you there?
Jul 25 13:46:43 <AnthonyUdacity>	Yes
Jul 25 13:47:16 <AnthonyUdacity>	How's everything going?
Jul 25 13:47:45 <Frazzle>	good I just had breakfast
Jul 25 13:49:28 <Frazzle>	I added a link to the irc logs on the wiki
Jul 25 13:50:50 <Frazzle>	That way the others can read the log and add feedback when we are not here
Jul 25 13:51:30 <Frazzle>	ITs seems that we will never all get together at the same time
Jul 25 13:53:10 <Frazzle>	zeffii,  what is that link to web2py for?
Jul 25 13:56:33 <Frazzle>	I see we have udacians/magazine repo going
Jul 25 19:17:33 <markup>	Hi David
Jul 25 20:10:46 <markup>	Hey Anthony, here now
Jul 25 20:11:38 <Frazzle>	I am here for about 15 min
Jul 25 20:13:21 <markup>	@David, might I ask where you're located?
Jul 25 20:13:22 <Frazzle>	then off to work:(
Jul 25 20:13:31 <markup>	your timezone, at least
Jul 25 20:13:34 <Frazzle>	south florida
Jul 25 20:13:51 <Frazzle>	but I work nights
Jul 25 20:14:03 <markup>	I see.
Jul 25 20:18:28 <Frazzle>	If You see others in here if they say what they think about things to be done or that they would like to see in the project. i will go through the logs and put together a summary of items mentioned.
Jul 25 20:19:04 <markup>	great.
Jul 25 20:19:52 <markup>	Can you quickly mention what you'd think the basic requirements should be for the site… what features should it have on launch day?
Jul 25 20:20:00 <Frazzle>	We may never all be able to get together at the same time and I want to get things moving
Jul 25 20:20:20 <markup>	Agreed.
Jul 25 20:20:59 <Frazzle>	https://dl.dropbox.com/u/43669141/My_Thoughts.txt
Jul 25 20:22:50 <markup>	ok. re-reading
Jul 25 20:23:42 <Frazzle>	I was hoping to get feedback from everyone
Jul 25 20:24:07 <markup>	Just to be sure we're talking about the same thing… by social network sharing, you mean like/tweet/share buttons, right?
Jul 25 20:24:47 <Frazzle>	yes but I could live without linked-in
Jul 25 20:25:56 <markup>	Everyone = you and I, Anthony, and zeffii, and maybe elssar.
Jul 25 20:26:38 <markup>	Let's just forge ahead with it and we can change things down the line based on ocmmunity feedback.
Jul 25 20:27:00 <Frazzle>	I dont care how many I just want to get going 
Jul 25 20:27:24 <Frazzle>	I agree You want to use NDB?
Jul 25 20:28:09 <markup>	yes, ndb
Jul 25 20:28:43 <Frazzle>	that way I get to learn something
Jul 25 20:29:15 <Frazzle>	I have read about it but not used it yet
Jul 25 20:30:01 <Frazzle>	I gotta go say good bye to un_Frazzle
Jul 25 20:30:14 *	You are now known as Un_Frazzle
Jul 25 20:30:32 <markup>	Have a good day at work. Catch you tomorrow.
Jul 25 20:36:03 <AnthonyUdacity>	marksup still  here?
Jul 25 20:36:16 <markup>	I am. Hi!
Jul 25 20:37:03 <markup>	Frazzle/David just left
Jul 25 20:39:45 <AnthonyUdacity>	no problem.
Jul 25 20:41:58 <AnthonyUdacity>	Wanted to share an idea with you all. To save everyone time and trouble.
Jul 25 20:42:26 <markup>	Go on…
Jul 25 20:42:28 <markup>	:)
Jul 25 20:53:43 <markup>	The suspense is killing me :P
Jul 25 20:56:02 <AnthonyUdacity>	Haha. Sorry about that.
Jul 25 20:56:20 <AnthonyUdacity>	Trying and failing to multitask.
Jul 25 20:56:21 <markup>	np :)
Jul 25 20:57:02 <AnthonyUdacity>	I'm sure you have the Contests of Contests thread?
Jul 25 20:57:10 <AnthonyUdacity>	http://forums.udacity.com/cs253/questions/30550/official-contest-of-contests-for-all-students
Jul 25 20:57:44 <markup>	yup.
Jul 25 20:58:33 <markup>	You want this magazine thingy built in to the social network?
Jul 25 21:07:39 <AnthonyUdacity>	Haha read my mind.
Jul 25 21:08:17 <AnthonyUdacity>	If you're up for it.
Jul 25 21:09:54 <markup>	Sounds like a good idea to me.
Jul 25 21:10:07 <AnthonyUdacity>	You, Frazzle, Elssar, SempaiScuba are good leaders and you bring good ideas to the table. So I'd like you all to forge the initiative with this idea.
Jul 25 21:10:16 <AnthonyUdacity>	I think you all will have a lot of support.
Jul 25 21:10:33 <AnthonyUdacity>	And I'll definitely be more involved since this will tie directly into a larger project that I have in the works.
Jul 25 21:11:03 <AnthonyUdacity>	But of course, I will not be around all of the time. And you all are obviously overqualified to achieve this.
Jul 25 21:12:57 <markup>	I love the idea, and think the others will too.
Jul 25 21:13:05 <AnthonyUdacity>	My suggestions, if possible: keep it **simple**. Get in touch with those students who were pushing the idea in the contest.
Jul 25 21:14:14 <markup>	+1 on keeping it simple.
Jul 25 21:15:04 <AnthonyUdacity>	Especially @Arsian
Jul 25 21:15:12 <AnthonyUdacity>	*@Arslan
Jul 25 21:16:02 <AnthonyUdacity>	Think of the social part of this as a framework.
Jul 25 21:16:15 <markup>	One thing to consider… the magazine could be heavily cached and be very inexpensive. A social network is a different beast altogether. Udacity will have to foot the bill or it won't work.
Jul 25 21:16:20 <AnthonyUdacity>	And the magazine a feature.
Jul 25 21:17:02 <AnthonyUdacity>	This is true. But it has to gain traction and approvement beforehand.
Jul 25 21:17:50 <AnthonyUdacity>	Near the middle of next week I'll have more free time.
Jul 25 21:19:23 <AnthonyUdacity>	I anticipate that the initial number of users will be small enough to manage.
Jul 25 21:19:34 <AnthonyUdacity>	Moreover, I want a good majority of students to be able to participate.
Jul 25 21:19:49 <markup>	Sounds good. Each feature will be a different app within the website. The core of a social network is the user profile page. That would be one app. Then you'd have a magazine app, a comments app, etc. At least I think that's how it will work.
Jul 25 21:20:04 <AnthonyUdacity>	and more
Jul 25 21:20:10 <AnthonyUdacity>	You, my friend, are a mindreader.
Jul 25 21:20:14 <markup>	So we might be able to have different teams working on different apps, etc
Jul 25 21:20:28 <markup>	hehe
Jul 25 21:20:37 <AnthonyUdacity>	EXACTLY!
Jul 25 21:21:43 <AnthonyUdacity>	The other apps I have in mind & will share later
Jul 25 21:21:57 <markup>	cool.
Jul 25 21:26:12 <AnthonyUdacity>	To go more in depth, each team should not only work on different apps, but we should have teams working on different parts of different apps.
Jul 25 21:26:17 <AnthonyUdacity>	starting with the magazine.
Jul 25 21:26:37 <AnthonyUdacity>	I wouldn't mind merging the code by hand
Jul 25 21:26:48 <AnthonyUdacity>	If people find GitHub hard to deal with.
Jul 25 21:27:02 <AnthonyUdacity>	I don't want to alienate those students who are not "experienced" programmers.
Jul 25 21:28:36 <markup>	Yeah, keeping the barriers to entry low is good.
Jul 25 21:29:26 <markup>	That said, with http://mac.github.com/ and http://windows.github.com/ you don't even know how to use git to contribute… just a few clicks. Easier to set up than GAE Launcher
Jul 25 21:30:03 <AnthonyUdacity>	Haha good point. I wanted to push the UI app, but I didn't personally like it.
Jul 25 21:30:05 <markup>	Someone will write a beginners git tutorial for the magazine
Jul 25 21:30:07 <AnthonyUdacity>	but you're right, it should work.
Jul 25 21:30:11 <AnthonyUdacity>	+1 to that :)
Jul 25 21:55:48 <AnthonyUdacity>	@mark_up So is this something we should initiate?
Jul 25 21:55:57 <AnthonyUdacity>	In your opinion?
Jul 25 22:04:28 <markup>	I have shitty internet today.
Jul 26 06:23:58 *	jin is now known as jinkoo
Jul 26 06:45:15 <jinkoo>	yo
Jul 26 06:46:47 <zeffii>	hey!
Jul 26 06:48:18 <zeffii>	Un_Frazzle, with a small IRC crowd logs will remain nice and short per day
Jul 26 06:48:44 <zeffii>	and won't be too much hassle for people to read
Jul 26 06:49:54 <zeffii>	logs can act as great timelines, and eventually - if this thing gets a kickstart - we can do nice visualization of how it all started
Jul 26 06:50:44 <zeffii>	sup jinkoo
Jul 26 06:50:57 <markup>	hey zeffii
Jul 26 06:51:07 <zeffii>	markup!
Jul 26 06:52:44 <jinkoo>	markdown!
Jul 26 06:52:49 <jinkoo>	kidding...
Jul 26 06:53:10 <markup>	hehe
Jul 26 06:53:53 <markup>	Anthony would like to merge this initiative with the social network project (from the contest of contests thread). Basically the magazine would become an app within the larger web app.
Jul 26 06:54:41 <markup>	We had a discussion on here today… hopefully Frazzle will be able to put the logs in his repo for all to read
Jul 26 06:55:22 <zeffii>	i've been toying aroudn with a CMS, not ready for any production environment but : http://zeffii.github.com/zen_cms/
Jul 26 06:56:06 <zeffii>	click on Text Appeal for google prettify mixed into markdown/showdown
Jul 26 06:58:01 <zeffii>	i hope we retain some autonomy as a student initiative
Jul 26 06:59:35 <markup>	Cool stuff.
Jul 26 06:59:52 <markup>	Can I see the source? zen_cms repo appears to be empty
Jul 26 07:00:06 <zeffii>	the branch is gh-pages
Jul 26 07:00:47 <markup>	ah, sorry, didn't notice the branch
Jul 26 07:01:43 <zeffii>	it's not very streamlined for a few reasons... didn't find a nice way to debug why gists don't embed
Jul 26 07:02:25 <zeffii>	but it might be a https://github dependancy
Jul 26 07:02:54 <zeffii>	anyway, not attached to any of the code it's just exploration
Jul 26 07:05:08 <markup>	love the 3d stuff on your website btw.
Jul 26 07:05:41 <zeffii>	thank you :)
Jul 26 07:06:56 <zeffii>	having an opensource tool like blender with python support is fantastic
Jul 26 07:07:32 <markup>	:)
Jul 26 07:08:52 <markup>	> i hope we retain some autonomy as a student initiative
Jul 26 07:09:31 <markup>	I believe we'll have that until the project is a success.
Jul 26 07:12:19 <markup>	Anyway, next step is for someone to write specifications. I can't write, so it'll either be one of you good folk, or we will dive right in and write code without any written spec.
Jul 26 07:12:43 <zeffii>	let's keep the specs minimal at first.
Jul 26 07:13:45 <markup>	I agree that is probably best.
Jul 26 07:13:49 <zeffii>	good software design is modular, so it doesn't need to know how it ens up being used :)
Jul 26 07:13:50 <jinkoo>	yay spec-less code
Jul 26 07:14:25 <markup>	@jinkoo my sarcasm detector is beeping away :P
Jul 26 07:14:25 <zeffii>	also possibly maintain a list of things we don't want to see in the code and why
Jul 26 07:15:59 <jinkoo>	comments
Jul 26 07:16:02 <jinkoo>	I HATE comments
Jul 26 07:16:11 <jinkoo>	taking up useless bytes
Jul 26 07:16:15 <zeffii>	remember, early nasa software was written without specs :)
Jul 26 07:16:23 <jinkoo>	also variable names more than three letters long.
Jul 26 07:16:57 <markup>	Hey, you can't have both. Pick one… lots of comments, or descriptive variable names :P
Jul 26 07:16:58 <zeffii>	you are a sick, sick man.
Jul 26 07:17:33 <zeffii>	descriptive variable names > comments
Jul 26 07:17:56 <zeffii>	but by all means use aliasing to keep things clean
Jul 26 07:17:58 <jinkoo>	I was going to put the code for my CS253 stuff up to show the separation of classes, but that's probably a bad idea
Jul 26 07:18:13 <zeffii>	dpc = data_protection_cache = { }
Jul 26 07:18:44 <markup>	@jinkoo… do you have a github account?
Jul 26 07:18:51 <markup>	Would be nice to see.
Jul 26 07:19:09 <jinkoo>	https://github.com/nixhope/
Jul 26 07:19:25 <zeffii>	i had to resist hard not to stick the full web app on github
Jul 26 07:19:46 <jinkoo>	I'm not putting the source for the web app up, it's too close to just uploading assignment answers.
Jul 26 07:20:00 <jinkoo>	source for https://udacityplus.appspot.com/main is up.
Jul 26 07:20:15 <jinkoo>	Gotta get it working on Chrome, then add the tab features.
Jul 26 07:20:19 <markup>	But the assignment answers has already been uploaded by steve himself
Jul 26 07:20:52 <markup>	have
Jul 26 07:20:53 <zeffii>	stick some padding in your content div :)
Jul 26 07:20:53 <jinkoo>	oh, have they?
Jul 26 07:20:56 <jinkoo>	for the wiki?
Jul 26 07:21:13 <zeffii>	i would like to see his wiki interpretation too
Jul 26 07:22:24 <markup>	hmm, not sure now. Huffman was uploading all his code a week after an assignment was due.
Jul 26 07:22:44 <jinkoo>	How does that link with the "finish a course whenever" policy?
Jul 26 07:23:32 <markup>	Because the qualification is useless anyway. If you want to learn, you do the work, if you cheat, you're only cheating yourself.
Jul 26 07:24:06 <zeffii>	> If you want to learn, you do the work,
Jul 26 07:24:17 <zeffii>	great sub title for the mag
Jul 26 07:24:25 <markup>	lol
Jul 26 07:24:29 <zeffii>	true tho
Jul 26 07:24:44 <zeffii>	no point people regurgitating and spoonfeeding :)
Jul 26 07:25:25 <zeffii>	but i think steve did a good job at backing off from spoonfeeding
Jul 26 07:25:44 <markup>	@jinkoo it's a little annoying at first, I know. To think that you worked hard to come up with your own solution and then realize that you get the same certfiicate as the other guy who just copypasted code.
Jul 26 07:26:37 <markup>	It's a pity you weren't around for the first run of the course… that was fun.
Jul 26 07:27:42 <jinkoo>	I like his rather cavalier coverage of some key themes: templating, OO, some other stuff. I was just thinking "people will have to actually do research"
Jul 26 07:29:41 <markup>	Anyway, i gotta head off soon.
Jul 26 07:30:21 <markup>	If nobody else does so, I'll commit some code tomorrow and you folks can rip it apart.
Jul 26 07:30:30 <jinkoo>	I need to work out how to debug on Chrome.
Jul 26 07:45:59 <zeffii>	markup on your github?
Jul 26 07:46:15 <zeffii>	we can discuss commit access
Jul 26 07:47:27 <jinkoo>	probably the udacious githun
Jul 26 07:49:07 <jinkoo>	*github
Jul 26 07:49:14 <zeffii>	jinko,  // isn't great for css comments
Jul 26 07:51:08 <jinkoo>	which site?
Jul 26 07:51:28 <zeffii>	https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3397495/protodidact/udacity/index.html
Jul 26 07:53:01 <jinkoo>	oh hey look at that
Jul 26 07:53:44 <jinkoo>	I guess they crept in from the JS work
Jul 26 08:12:48 <jinkoo>	sleep time
