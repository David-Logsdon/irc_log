**** BEGIN LOGGING AT Thu Jul 26 08:22:24 2012

Jul 26 12:16:28 *	Received a CTCP TIME from AnthonyUdacity
Jul 26 17:07:47 *	You are now known as Frazzle
Jul 26 19:53:52 <Frazzle>	markup, Howdy
Jul 26 19:58:32 <markup>	Hey Frazzle
Jul 26 20:03:23 <Frazzle>	How goes it
Jul 26 20:13:45 <markup>	good, thanks.
Jul 26 20:15:31 <markup>	What do you think about the magazine being part of the larger website?
Jul 26 20:15:38 <Frazzle>	Let me know if You think this is simple enough for a non-web developer to use. : https://gist.github.com/3185347
Jul 26 20:16:45 <Frazzle>	I'm ok with that, as long as we work on this before spliting up to help other teams
Jul 26 20:17:37 <Frazzle>	I still need to add more to it
Jul 26 20:18:51 <markup>	Looks good
Jul 26 20:19:56 <markup>	Simple enough. If someone has trouble, they can always just send us a text or word document and we can format it ourselves.
Jul 26 20:20:07 <Frazzle>	We could  commenting system to let the other teams have a headstart
Jul 26 20:20:23 <Frazzle>	insert seperate
Jul 26 20:20:54 <markup>	Yes, the commenting system will need to be its own app
Jul 26 20:21:39 <markup>	An app for commenting, an app for articles, an app for user profiles, etc
Jul 26 20:22:06 <Frazzle>	yes that is easy enough
Jul 26 20:22:22 <Frazzle>	I like the idea.
Jul 26 20:22:50 <Frazzle>	the runner-up Idea I like too
Jul 26 20:24:19 <markup>	Gotta work on my day job for the next 6hrs, but then will have around 4hrs to write some code.
Jul 26 20:24:43 <Frazzle>	ok see you tomorow
Jul 26 20:25:28 <markup>	i telecommute, so i'll be online the entire time… just not writing code for the website until after
Jul 26 20:29:27 <markup>	runner-up idea is great, but way too tough to be a student project
Jul 26 20:30:16 <markup>	Would have to be javascript based
Jul 26 21:17:48 *	You are now known as Un_Frazzle
Jul 26 21:40:23 <jinkoo>	markup: so are you writing some code?
Jul 26 21:40:45 <markup>	>Gotta work on my day job for the next 6hrs, but then will have around 4hrs to write some code.
Jul 26 21:40:53 <markup>	> i telecommute, so i'll be online the entire time… just not writing code for the website until after
Jul 26 21:43:15 <markup>	Don't let me hold you back :)
Jul 26 21:51:32 <jinkoo>	I'm still working on Udacity Plus.
Jul 26 21:51:53 <markup>	cool
Jul 26 21:52:10 <jinkoo>	I moved to gm_XHR instead of jsonp
Jul 26 21:52:23 <jinkoo>	or rather my hack-to-getjsonp-working-with-greasemonkey
Jul 26 21:52:43 <jinkoo>	hopefully at some point the functionality promised in the udacity.com source will be added
Jul 26 22:03:05 <jinkoo>	I still don't have a sufficiently clear handle on the scope in order to write any code
Jul 26 22:03:15 <jinkoo>	my spec-less code comment notwithstanding
Jul 26 22:04:08 <markup>	We start with the blog we created during the course, change it a little, and then we add features.
Jul 26 22:05:04 <markup>	A spec would be nice, but unless someone volunteers to write it, we will just have to wing it.
Jul 26 22:11:24 <AnthonyUdacity>	Hey everyone! How's it going?
Jul 26 22:11:32 <markup>	Hey Anthony
Jul 26 22:12:44 <AnthonyUdacity>	@markup Are you still prepared to integrate the magazine w/ social?
Jul 26 22:15:16 <markup>	Yup. No objections from anyone so far.
Jul 26 22:15:56 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to AnthonyUdacity
Jul 26 22:16:09 <--	AnthonyUdacity has kicked udacityu from ##udacitymagazine (udacityu)
Jul 26 22:16:43 <AnthonyUdacity>	That great to hear. Just wanted to confirm before it was officially announced.
Jul 26 22:16:47 <AnthonyUdacity>	So everyone is on the same page?
Jul 26 22:18:30 <markup>	Yes. Not everyone is interested in the whole thing, but since we'll be keeping it modular, everyone can work on just the bit they're interested in.
Jul 26 22:19:37 <AnthonyUdacity>	Right, of course.
Jul 26 22:26:53 <AnthonyUdacity>	I've come up with a basic framework for the site. It does, admittedly yet unpurposefully, resemble Facebook. However, I'm comfortable with the design as I plan to pull in content from the forum since leading users away from the forum is something I cannot support.
Jul 26 22:28:23 <markup>	Any chance we can get a peek at it?
Jul 26 22:29:01 <AnthonyUdacity>	After I make the announcement of the winning social network entry, we'll start by gather everyone's ideas (everyone = all students on the forum who want to participate) concerning the functionality that they'd like to see. We'll prioritize this list, break up into teams, and begin work.
Jul 26 22:29:44 <jinkoo>	Anthony: you might be interested in Udacity Plus :). Maybe at some point we can merge.
Jul 26 22:30:10 <jinkoo>	One thing that I want to get working soon is the ability to + a forum question or answer to upvote it to article status
Jul 26 22:30:13 <AnthonyUdacity>	@markup Know that the framework is only conceptual. I plan to mock it up in the next couple of days.
Jul 26 22:30:32 <markup>	ok
Jul 26 22:30:47 <AnthonyUdacity>	@jinkoo UdacityPlus? Do you have a link?
Jul 26 22:31:47 <markup>	Guys. Gotta head out, pick up my son from school. Back in 30mins.
Jul 26 22:31:59 <AnthonyUdacity>	@markup Talk to you later.
Jul 26 22:33:27 <jinkoo>	https://udacityplus.appspot.com
Jul 26 22:33:31 <jinkoo>	also on github
Jul 26 22:33:35 <AnthonyUdacity>	Just checked it out.
Jul 26 22:33:39 <jinkoo>	although I haven't pushed an update
Jul 26 22:33:52 <jinkoo>	*the latest update, which is more a functionality fix
Jul 26 22:34:03 <jinkoo>	it's obviously still in development, but I wanted to post it up
Jul 26 22:34:07 <AnthonyUdacity>	Is this your project?
Jul 26 22:34:22 <jinkoo>	yeah
Jul 26 22:34:29 <AnthonyUdacity>	Nice!
Jul 26 22:35:40 <AnthonyUdacity>	So the Articles are popular forum posts?
Jul 26 22:36:45 <jinkoo>	yeah, I just mocked something up as you can see.
Jul 26 22:37:19 <jinkoo>	You can read the mock-ups yourself.
Jul 26 22:37:20 <jinkoo>	https://udacityplus.appspot.com/api/articles/get?fn=content
Jul 26 22:38:12 <jinkoo>	In future people will themselves be able to '+' a post so that it gets nominated for article status. There will also be a crawler to find good posts.
Jul 26 22:39:00 <AnthonyUdacity>	When this UdacityMagazine magazine project becomes functional, I think the extension you've developed would definitely be a cool add-on to merge with.
Jul 26 22:39:12 <jinkoo>	But those ones there I crawled a few pages, and then wrote a 1-2 sentence description of some of the most promising posts.
Jul 26 22:41:05 <AnthonyUdacity>	@jinkoo Good work though. I have to head out. I'll catch up with everyone later.
Jul 26 23:12:26 <jinkoo>	it's other me
Jul 26 23:12:46 <darksentinel>	yes, yes it is
Jul 27 00:53:53 <elssar>	Hey
Jul 27 02:22:12 <darksentinel>	back
Jul 27 03:34:48 <darksentinel>	yo
Jul 27 03:35:03 <darksentinel>	https://github.com/nixhope/basic-wikiblog
Jul 27 03:42:31 <darksentinel>	in case anyone wants to build on that for a CMS.
Jul 27 04:01:37 <markup>	good stuff.
